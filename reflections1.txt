What changes did you make in your design between wireframe and build?

I didn't really make many changes. I made the colors of the sections alternate down the page, and I added a small
colored line to separate the header from the hero section.


Why did you make them?

I thought it would be easier to read and distinguish between the different sections with the alternating colors,
and I thought the small line looked cool.


What did you learn from this process?

I have much to learn. I still don't quite like the look of the text or the links, the GitHub Logo is not vertically
aligned with the LinkedIn Logo, and I still need to figure out how to use grid-template-areas to maintain a header for
all screen sizes in the skills section. I might even just refactor the website to use grid areas for better modularity.
