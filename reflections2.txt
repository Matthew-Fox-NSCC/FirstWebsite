What changes did you make between your desktop version and the mobile version?

I changed the navigation bar and one of the section grids to use CSS Grids instead of the solutions I was using before.
I also managed to fix the dark mode version of the site as well.


Why did you make them?

The intention of switching to CSS Grids was to make everything more modular. It didn't really work that well, I still
had to have separate pieces of HTML for the desktop and mobile versions. I think switching to Grids made the skill
grid easier to work with but introduced some issues that had to be circumvented in the navigation bar.


What did you learn from this process?

I Learned a lot more about CSS Grids and how to change between different versions of an HTML website depending on
different circumstances. I had a cutoff at 700px of width and a light and dark mode implementation in this version.
I also managed to host this website on GitHub Pages with a custom domain, https://matthew-k-fox.com/.
