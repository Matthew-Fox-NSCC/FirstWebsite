        <h2>Hello</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a software developer based in Halifax, NS. I grew up in Nova Scotia and I will forever wonder why the
           rest of the world doesn't have garlic fingers. I like problem-solving and logic, anything complex I enjoy
           tackling.

        <h2>My Career so Far</h2>
        
        <p>
            I spent two years at Dalhousie University for computer science before realizing that wasn't the best way
            for me to learn. I went to the NSCC for IT Programming afterward and I learned a lot, from building this
            website in my first semester to making an application end-to-end with a team of students using Agile
            development practices.
